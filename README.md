### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my PhD in the field of explainable AI, focusing on developing intuitive ways for machines to communicate their decision-making processes.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying advanced topics in machine learning and AI, particularly interested in deep learning and neural networks.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to AI, especially those that aim to make technology more accessible and understandable to the general public.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with data visualization and user interface design to enhance the interpretability of complex AI models.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to AI, machine learning, or the journey of pursuing a PhD in a cutting-edge tech field. I'm also well-versed in Python and data analysis.

âš¡ Fun fact: Aside from my tech life, I'm a traveller and a coffee enthusiast. I believe a good day starts with a perfect cup of coffee and ends with conquering a challenging climbing route.
